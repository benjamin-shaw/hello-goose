# Hello Goose!

A really simple demo application for Pivotal Application Service / Cloud Foundry.

Just run `cf push` to use.

The application will provide a photo of a goose running in 3 container instances. It will also display the instance ID that served your request so that you can see the load balancing working and the container lifecycle when you work with the application.

The cropped goose image has been donated into the public domain by the photographer.
